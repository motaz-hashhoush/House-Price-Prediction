# House Price Prediction Project

Welcome to my House Price Prediction project! In this repository, I've tackled the challenge of predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. The project was developed as part of the Kaggle competition ["House Price Prediction: Advanced Regression Techniques"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Overview

The goal of this project was to accurately predict house prices based on a rich dataset of features, including numerical, categorical, and temporal attributes. Leveraging data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization, I aimed to create robust regression models that can provide accurate estimates of house sale prices.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables.
- Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
- Feature engineering to extract valuable information from the raw data.
- Implementation of advanced regression techniques for accurate predictions.
- Model evaluation using cross-validation and performance metrics.

## Repository Contents

- `data/`: This folder contains the dataset provided by Kaggle, including both the training and test sets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step process of data analysis, feature engineering, and model development.
- `predictions/`: This folder holds the predictions made by the trained models on the test dataset.
- `README.md`: You're reading it! An overview of the project, its contents, and how to use it.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd house-price-prediction`
3. Open and explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
4. Follow the notebooks to understand the data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling process.
5. The `predictions/` directory contains the predictions made by the models on the test set.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. (See requirements.txt for details)

## Note

This project is for educational and demonstrative purposes, showcasing my data science skills. It was originally created for the Kaggle competition and is shared here to highlight my expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
